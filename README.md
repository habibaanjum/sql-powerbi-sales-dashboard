# Sales Performance Dashboard – Data Analysis Project
End-to-end Business Intelligence project using SQL Server for data transformation and Power BI for interactive dashboard visualization.

#Project Overview
This project analyzes sales transaction data to uncover insights related to revenue trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
Using SQL Server for data preparation and Power BI for visualization, the goal is to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business insights that support decision-making.

#Business Problem
The business needs visibility into:

Overall revenue performance
Monthly sales trends

#Tools & Technologies

Microsoft SQL Server (Data querying & preparation)
T-SQL (Data aggregation & KPI calculations)
Power BI Desktop (Dashboard & visualization)
DAX (Measures & time intelligence)

#Data Preparation
Raw sales data was imported into SQL Server and structured into analytical tables.

Using SQL:
Cleaned inconsistent records
Calculated revenue metrics
